# React Context. Provider and Consumer Components

This library uses React Context API to provide Yandex.Maps API to every
component, that needs it.

This library also uses React Context API so parent Yandex.Maps objects (e.g.,
Map, Clusterer, ObjectManager) could provide children Yandex.Maps objects with a
parent instance.

If you want to know more about React Context and Provider/Consumer components,
you can check out [React documentation section on the topic][4.1.1].

> `WARN` Make sure that you used YMaps provider component and all Yandex.Maps
> objects are inside this component tree. This library will throw an error, if
> the Yandex.Maps context is missing.
