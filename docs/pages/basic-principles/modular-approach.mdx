# Modular Approach

This library heavily utilizes Yandex.Maps API module system to make amount of
downloaded and executed code from Yandex.Maps as minimal as possible. There are
some pros and cons to this system and there are also a way to opt out of this
completely.

By default this library will download only the modules that are actually
rendered on the page. If `<Placemark />` or `<ObjectManager />` is not mounted
in the page, corresponding would not be downloaded.

That means that the amount of code your clients will download and execute will
be as minimal as possible. On the other hand that means that instead of getting
a lot of familiar Yandex.Maps API modules by default, now you need to really
think about what you are using on the page.

In the example below, we are mounting Map with a Placemark on the page:

```jsx
// @live

const state = { center: [55.75, 37.57], zoom: 9 };

const Application = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <Map defaultState={state}>
      <Placemark defaultGeometry={state.center} />
    </Map>
  </YMaps>
);

render(<Application />);
```

You can notice that all map controls that are usually provided on the map by
default are missing here. This is happening because they are not part of the
"core" Yandex.Maps module, not they are part of the Map or Placemark module.

## Loading Modules with `modules` Prop

Let's fix this by specifying which controls we want exactly in the map `state`
and then let's use the `modules` prop to load the ones we need:

```jsx
const state = {
  center: [55.75, 37.57],
  zoom: 9,
  controls: ['zoomControl', 'fullscreenControl'],
};

const Application = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <Map
      defaultState={state}
      modules={['control.ZoomControl', 'control.FullscreenControl']}
    >
      <Placemark defaultGeometry={state.center} />
    </Map>
  </YMaps>
);

render(<Application />);
```

Nice! Now we have controls on the map and we also avoided downloading the full
package of Yandex.Maps API.

All components in this library support `modules` prop, that will allow you to
download additional modules when they are needed.

Let's add another one to the example above. This time we will add balloon to the
placemark. Balloon module is not downloaded with the base minimum bundle of
Yandex.Maps API, so to actually see ballon we need to specify balloon addon as a
module on the Placemark component.

```jsx
// @live

const state = {
  center: [55.75, 37.57],
  zoom: 9,
  controls: ['zoomControl', 'fullscreenControl'],
};

const Application = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <Map
      defaultState={state}
      modules={['control.ZoomControl', 'control.FullscreenControl']}
    >
      <Placemark
        modules={['geoObject.addon.balloon']}
        defaultGeometry={state.center}
        properties={{
          balloonContentBody:
            'This is balloon loaded by the Yandex.Maps API module system',
        }}
      />
    </Map>
  </YMaps>
);

render(<Application />);
```

## Loading Modules With YMaps Provider `query` Prop

Manually specifying required modules is not the only way to load them. You can
also take advantage of `load` option when you are specifying `query` on your
Provider component.

This option is part of Yandex.Maps API request and can be used to define what
modules you want to load right away with the Yandex.Maps API.

Lets see how the previous example could be changed to use this option:

```jsx
// @live

const state = {
  center: [55.75, 37.57],
  zoom: 9,
  controls: ['zoomControl', 'fullscreenControl'],
};

const Application = () => (
  <YMaps
    query={{
      ns: 'use-load-option',
      load:
        'Map,Placemark,control.ZoomControl,control.FullscreenControl,geoObject.addon.balloon',
    }}
  >
    <Map defaultState={state}>
      <Placemark
        defaultGeometry={state.center}
        properties={{
          balloonContentBody:
            'This is balloon is pre-loaded with initial Yandex.Maps API request',
        }}
      />
    </Map>
  </YMaps>
);

render(<Application />);
```

Notice how we removed all `modules` props from all components and used
`query.load` prop instead to specify all modules that are required.

> `INFO` Yandex.Maps API default value for this option is `package.full`.
> Setting `query.load` to `'package.full'` will set this library to the mode
> that is completely matching the default Yandex.Maps API behavior
