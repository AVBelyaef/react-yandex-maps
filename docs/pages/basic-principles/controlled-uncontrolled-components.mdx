# Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

Important React pattern that you should be aware of when using this library is
controlled and uncontroled components. This pattern is all about who is
responsible for handling updates and storing components state.

Applied to this library, that means that based on which props you are using,
either Yandex.Maps API or your application will be responsible for being the
source of truth for your map objects.

In the example below, map state (more specifically zoom and coordinates) is
controlled by application on the first map component, but is not controlled by
application on the second map component. When you click the button, first map
zoom and coordinates will be updated, but the second map will preserve its
state. This happens because instead of `state` prop, we are using `defaultState`
prop.

```jsx
// @live

class Application extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { center: [55.75, 37.57], zoom: 9 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <YMaps>
        <React.Fragment>
          <button
            onClick={() =>
              this.setState(prevState => ({
                zoom: prevState.zoom === 9 ? 12 : 9,
              }))
            }
          >
            Toggle map zoom
          </button>
          <div>
            <p>Controlled map:</p>
            <Map state={this.state} />
            <hr />
            <p>Uncontrolled map:</p>
            <Map defaultState={this.state} />
          </div>
        </React.Fragment>
      </YMaps>
    );
  }
}

render(<Application />);
```

Every prop on every map object is this library supports the `default` version
(e.g, `state` and `defaultState`, `options` and `defaultOptions`, `properties`
and `defaultProperties`, `geometry` and `defaultGeometry`). By choosing to use
`default` version you are opting out of this library updating map objects when
the props are changed.

> `WARN` As mentioned in the "What Is Supported" section, there is no way to
> prevent Yandex.Maps from updating maps objects state completely, so it is very
> easy to go out of sync if you are using these components in a controlled way
> and not synchronizing the state back to your application state.
>
> From the personal experience you would want to use `default` props for most of
> the cases in your app and maybe even update maps object instances manually in
> the rare cases where this is actually needed.
