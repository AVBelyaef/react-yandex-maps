# Higher-Order Component Creator Function

This library comes with a HOC creator function that can give any component in
your application an access to Yandex.Maps API.

Creating HOC with this function will give your components access to Yandex.Maps
API object. You can use this API in your components in various ways.

> `INFO` Keep in mind that by default `react-yandex-maps` loads only the small
> core of Yandex.Maps API, so if you need access to something that is not
> included in the core of Yandex.Maps, you need to explicitly specify this.
> There are several ways to do this: with the third argument of the `withYMaps`
> HOC (as shown in the example above), with the `modules` prop of connected
> component, or by providing required module in `query.load` prop of `<YMaps />`
> component

In the example below we are creating a HOC that will load Yandex.Maps Route API,
and them we are using this API inside our `LengthPrinter` component to display
route length on the screen

<Playground>
{() => {
    class LengthPrinter extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        this.state = { routeLength: null };
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        this._isMounted = true;

        this.props.ymaps.route(this.props.route).then(route => {
          if (this._isMounted === true) {
            this.setState({
              routeLength: route.getHumanLength().replace('&#160;', ' '),
            });
          }
        });
      }

      componentWillUnmount() {
        this._isMounted = false;
      }

      render() {
        return this.state.routeLength == null ? (
          <p>Loading route...</p>
        ) : (
          <p>This route is {this.state.routeLength} long</p>
        );
      }
    }

    const ConnectedLengthPrinter = withYMaps(LengthPrinter, true, ['route']);
    return <YMaps query={{ lang: 'en_RU' }}>
               <ConnectedLengthPrinter route={['Moscow, Russia', 'Berlin, Germany']} />
             </YMaps>

} }

</Playground>

> `WARN` Don't forget that any component from this library (even those created
> with the HOC creator function) need to be wrapped in `YMaps` provider
> component
