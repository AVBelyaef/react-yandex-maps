## Events

All Yandex.Maps object [events][] are supported on the components in this library. 
To pass an event handler to Yandex.Maps object add `on` to the even name and pass it as a prop.

Here are a few examples comparing Yandex.Maps API way to attaching events with `react-yandex-maps`:

```jsx
const handleClick = (event) => console.log('Clicked', event);

// With Yandex.Maps API you would do
// something like this:
map.events.add('click', handleClick);

// With react-yandex-maps just pass
// a handler how you would usually
// do it in React:
<Map onClick={handleClick} />

// This works for all components
// provided by this library:
<GeoObject onClick={handleClick} />
```
