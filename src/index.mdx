# `react-yandex-maps`

`react-yandex-maps` is a wrapper around Yandex.Maps API that allows you to
render Yandex Maps in your React application with minimum amount of hassle ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started

### Installation

To add the library to your project you can either use one of the CDN services

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-yandex-maps/dist/react-yandex-maps.umd.js"></script>
```

Or npm/yarn to install the library from npm registry:

```bash
# With npm:
npm install --save react-yandex-maps
# With yarn:
yarn add react-yandex-maps
```

### Adding Maps to Your Application

Adding maps to your application can be splitted in two steps.

First, we will add provider component, that will handle loading the Yandex.Maps
API and providing it to any interested component on the page. Usually you don't
want to have several providers on one page. A good place to put your provider
could the at the top of your application:

```jsx
import { YMaps } from 'react-yandex-maps';

const App = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <div>My awesome application with maps!</div>
  </YMaps>
);
```

Then add the Map component with desired state somewhere on the page:

```jsx
import { YMaps, Map } from 'react-yandex-maps';

const App = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <div>
      My awesome application with maps!
      <Map defaultState={{ center: [55.75, 37.57], zoom: 9 }} />
    </div>
  </YMaps>
);
```

That's it! Now, as soon as Yandex.Maps API is loaded by `YMaps` provider
component, `Map` component will render `ymaps.Map` object on the page.

Before you start playing around with the library I higly recommend taking a
quick look at the "What is supported?" section and a more thorough look at
"Basic Principles" section

## What Is Supported?

This library is a thin wrapper over Yandex.Maps API, a lot of Yandex.Maps API
objects and features are supported with React components but not all of them and
not all of their features.

<!-- Here is a list of supported features and objects:

### Supported Features

- [x] Modifying Yandex.Maps API request via `YMaps` provider component
- [x] Getting acces to Yandex.Maps API in your components via `withYMaps` HOC
- [x] Granular load of the required API modules with Yandex.Maps modules API
- [x] Controlled and uncontrolled components for every supported object
- [x] Enterprise API via `YMaps` `query` prop

> `WARN` Controlled props that are mentioned above are not 100% controlled as
> there is no way to stop Yandex.Maps objects from updating completely with the
> library API. When using controlled props, you should keep in mind that your
> state/properties/options and Yandex.Maps object state/properties/options could
> go out of sync.

### Supported Yandex.Maps Objects

- [x] Map

#### GeoObjects

- [x] GeoObject
- [x] Placemark
- [x] Polyline
- [x] Rectangle
- [x] Polygon
- [x] Circle
- [x] Clusterer

#### Controls

- [x] Button

## What Is Not Supported?

Rendering React DOM nodes to the Yandex.Maps template factories is not supported
(i.e., you can't render balloon content with React with this library out of the
box)

<!-- ### Basic Principles

There are a few basic principles that are forming the base of this library. It
will be very helpful to keep those in mind, when you are using it.

- [Modular Approach][4.1]
- [Controlled and Uncontrolled Components][4.2]
- [React Context. Provider and Consumer Components][4.3]
